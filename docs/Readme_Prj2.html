<b>2. How to run?</b>
<p>

   * Compile on clic machines <br>
     1) Go into directory webdb/src/ <br>
     2) option1: type 'make' <br>
     3) option2: manually compile: <br>
     	javac -cp ".:lib/*" Test.java <br>

</p>

<p>

   * Run tests <br>
     1) Go into directory webdb/src <br>
     2) option 1: run script ./run.sh apikey minspecificity mincoverage host<br>
     3) option 2: type make run ARG1=apikey ARG2=minspecificity ARG3=mincoverage ARG4=host <br>
     4) option 3: manually run java <br>
     	java -cp ".:lib/*" Test apikey minspecificity mincoverage host <br>
        
	Example: java -cp ".:lib/*" test your-bing-api
	0.6 100 yahoo.com <br>

     5) Resulting categories are displayed on screen <br>
     6) Content summary are captured in text files.  The file names are displayed on the screen<br>
<br>

<b>3. System design</b></br>
<br>
 Our system is decoupled into several modules. The main classTest.java in the default package processes the arguments passed to the and interacts with other modules to determine the category of the host, and generate the content summary.  
<br><br>
Following arguments are passed to the main function - <br>

1) API Key <br>
2) min-specificity <br> 
3) min-coverage <br>
4) host <br>
<br>
The program is broken into following modules - <br>
1) cache - The classes contained in this module provides caching of the data.  We cache following data - query probe results and sample documents that are collected for each query.  We provide an abstract class for caching, that 'DocumentCache' and 'ProbeCache' classes inherit from.  By providing the abstract class, we can easily add new classes to cache more data by inheriting from the abstract 'cache' class. <br>
<br>
2) Classifier - This module only contains DatabaseClassifier class.  It's the class that is used to by 'main' method in Test.java to classify the host.  <br>
<br>
3) Database - This module contains classes that are responsible for probing the host database.  Cached data is checked before requesting the data from the host.  If the data can be retrieved from the cache, host is not queried.  If the cache does not contain the data, host is queried and the data is added to cache.  We provide a abstract class here so that we can easily change/add various different probing algorithms without impacting the overall design.<br>
<br>
4) Hierarchy - This module is used to populate the cateogory hierarchy as provided in the project description.  It also contains classes to read and populate the rules associated with each category. <br>
<br>
5) Query - This module contains the data classes and the parser class to populate the data structures for the results retrieved by probing the host. <br>
<br>
6) Searcher - This module contains the classes to populate and execute bing query based on on the query terms associated with a category.  We provide an abstract class here, to further expand it to a different search engine. <br>
<br>
7) Summarizer - This module contains the classes to download the webpages and generate the content summary.  Lynx is used to download the webpage as described in the project description. <br>
<br>
8) util - this module contains a singleton Logger class to create the run.log and error.log.<br>
<br>
