<b>2. How to run?</b>
<p>

   * Compile on clic machines <br>
     1) Go into directory relevance/ <br>
     2) option1: type 'make' <br>
     3) option2: manually compile: <br>
     	javac -cp ".:lib/*" RelevanceFeedback.java <br>

</p>

<p>

   * Run tests <br>
     1) Go into directory relevance/ <br>
     2) option 1: run script ./run.sh apikey precision 'query keywords': <br>
     3) option 2: type make run ARG1=apikey ARG2=precision ARG3='query keywords' <br>
     4) option 3: manually run java <br>
     	java -cp ".:lib/*" RelevanceFeedback apikey
     	precision 'query keywords' <br>
        
	Example: java -cp ".:lib/*" RelevanceFeedback your-bing-api
	0.8 'bill gates' <br>

     5) Interact with the UI for feedbacks and results <br>
     6) You can also check the result in Transcript_Log.txt <br>

<b>3. System design</b></br>
 Our system is decoupled into several modules. The main classTest.java in the default package processes the arguments passed to the and interacts with other modules to determine the category of the host, and generate the content summary.  
<br><br>
Following arguments are passed to the main function - <br>
 
   interface and interacting with other modules. The main class read
   user's query from commandline and issue the query to a
   SearchProvider, in this case, the Bing API. It then presents the
   query result to user to get feedbacks. If we haven't reach the
   desired precision, RelevanceFeedback calls an Expander to expand
   the query and search with the revised query. An expander chooses
   words to expand based on the results of several analyzers. An
   analyzer assign a weight to each term according to different
   statistics of a term, e.g. its frequency in titles/descriptions. An
   analyzer may depend on some utitly classes to gather the statistics.<br>
<br>
   Here, we have two important abstraction. The
   TermAnalyzer class is an abstract class that is used to assign
   weights to terms. While the Expander class is an abstract class
   that take the relevant terms (high weight terms) from term
   analyzers and decide which words to expand and what is the right order of
   the keywords.<br>
<br>
   We can easily plug in or replace term analysis and query expansion
   methods by inheriting the abstract class. We can even mix various
   methods together by taking advantage of their common interfaces.<br>
<br>
   In the Searcher package, we also have a abstract class for
   SearchProvider, in case that we may want to use other search
   engines other than Bing to finish the task.<br>
<br>
   Some utitlies class about query result parsing, inverted index
   building can be found in query and indexer package. We also use
   some third-party libraries to do the mundane jobs (all the
   libraries we use are listed in the appendix of this doc).<br>
